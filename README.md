Analyzing and Visualizing Top Hashtags in Tweet Data


This Python code reads a dataset of tweets and their corresponding labels from a CSV file. It then extracts hashtags from the tweets using regular expressions and calculates the frequency of each hashtag for two different labels (0 and 1). The code generates two bar plots to visualize the top 10 hashtags associated with each label, providing insights into the most common hashtags used in tweets for each category.
